> This is a demo project to design a Tetris Game on Pure Javascript based on OOP.

![Game Example](./raw/preview_game.gif)
 
## âš¡ Getting Started

There aren't many things to do before start working with this service. 
If you are used to work with javascript and webpack, just `Clone` 
this repo, `install` dependencies and `start` dev server or `build` the static version of page to easily be deploy on your own hosting. 

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Now, we are going to describe each step exposed above to download and start you own local version of service.

##### *Clone Git Repository*
```Markdown
# Download Git Project
$ git clone https://github.com/escaLatamGit/TetrisDemo.git
``` 
##### *Install Node Dependencies*
```Markdown
# Run this command on project's root folder
# install dependencies
$ npm install
``` 

#### ðŸŽ‰ Usage   
There's no need to configure anything to run the application.
 If you correctly installed all project dependencies, you must 
 use `Development Server` to access to local version of this game, run `start` npm script
  to start a local server at port 8080 with hotreload version of page. Then, you would access to game
 in your browser at given URL (http://localhost:8080):
```Markdown
# Run this command on project's root folder
# start local dev server
$ npm run start
``` 
#### ðŸš€ Deployment
Webpack allows us to make a compiled version of project to be upload/deployed
 on an instance of static server o just published on your preferred hosting service. 
 By default, distribution files are generated on `$root/dist`   with all requirements of the application. 
 To generate application bundle, just run npm `build` script. 
```Markdown
# Run this command on project's root folder
# Generate static version of the game
$ npm run build
```
